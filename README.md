# React-Native-Tutorial for Tech For Social Good
Since this guide is for those new to mobile app development, we will be using the Expo platform to run our React Native app. There is another option called React Native Cli, but it is more complicated because it doesn't have beginner friendly options. 

If you are more experienced with mobile app development and would like to dive deeper into more native modules (meaning operating system specific modules like face recognition, augmented reality, more customizable push notfiications), I suggest learning Swift for iOS devices and Android Studio for Android devices instead. Expo is meant to be an introduction for new mobile app developers or for apps that do not require complicated features. React Native is also much easier to pick up than the other platforms, and so for our purposes, we will use Expo with React Native to build our app and build the foundations for your mobile app development skills.
